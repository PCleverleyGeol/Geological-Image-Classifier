This is an open free YOLO8 Computer Vision model to celebrate Earth Science week 2024.
For those interested to experiment in the geosciences with Artificial Intelligence (AI).
The model predicts a class for geological images that are extracted from documents into the following categories:

REMOTE SENSING: 
LOCATION MAP: 
GEOLOGY MAP: 
MODEL: 
SEISMIC SECTION: 
OUTCROP: 
BOREHOLE LOG: 
CORE PHOTOGRAPH: 
THIN SECTION: 
SEM PHOTO: 
CHART-CROSSPLOT: 

The model itself has been trained using Datature no-code app, with several hundred low resolution thumbnails from Fatkun Batch Downloader from Google's image search.
Despite this, evaluation training metrics indicate an F1 of 0.7. I will update the repository as the model improves and also add additional categories.
